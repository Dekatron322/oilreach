                                <p>SamyungTV AIX3-series ensures that reliable, easy access to satellite TV in digital picture and sound on yacht while sailing or mooring. AIX3-series consist of a stabilized 39cm (15″)~120cm(48″) diameter antenna enclosed in an attractive white radome and an ACU(Antenna Control Unit).</p>  <p>The ACU has the operation interface for the communication with Samyung TV antenna via RS232C port. Aix3-390 and Aix3-450 is designed for power and small yacht. Aix3-390 and Aix3-450 is smallest size and lightest weight.</p>  <p>Built-in GPS and 3-axis servo stabilization tracking system will be serving you fully stabilized TV channel from the satellite. Aix3-610 and Aix3-850 provides increased signal reception area at sea and stronger signal reception in inclement weather because the larger dish is able to acquire more of the satellite’s signal and increase the antenna gain.</p>
